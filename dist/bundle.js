 * 2. License Grants and Conditions
 * --------------------------------
 *
 * 2.1. Grants
 *
 * Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 * non-exclusive license:
 *
 * (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
 * Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
 * modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
 * Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
 * as part of a Larger Work; and
 *
 * (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
 * for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
 * Contributions or its Contributor Version.
 *
 * 2.2. Effective Date
 *
 * The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 * become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 * distributes such Contribution.
 *
 * 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 *
 * The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 * this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 * distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 * Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 * Contributor:
 *
 * (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
 * or
 *
 * (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
 * modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
 * Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
 * Version); or
 *
 * (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
 * its Contributions.
 *
 * This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 * or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 * the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 *
 * 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 *
 * No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 * distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 * License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 * permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 *
 * 2.5. Representation
 *
 * Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 * Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 * to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 *
 * 2.6. Fair Use
 *
 * This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 * applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 * equivalents.
 *
 * 2.7. Conditions
 *
 * Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 * in Section 2.1.
 *
 * 3. Responsibilities
 * -------------------
 *
 * 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 *
 * All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 * Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 * the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 * Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 * License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 * attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 * Form.
 *
 * 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 *
 * If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 *
 * (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
 * Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
 * the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
 * Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
 * than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 *
 * (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
 * License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
 * license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
 * the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 *
 * 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 *
 * You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 * provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 * the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 * Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 * Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 * License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 * under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 * the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 * Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 * License(s).
 *
 * 3.4. Notices
 *
 * You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 * (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 * or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 * the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 * the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 *
 * 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 *
 * You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 * indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 * Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 * behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 * such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 * You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 * liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 * indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 * disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 * jurisdiction.
 *
 * 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 * License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 * statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 * the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 * describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 * be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 * Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 * or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 * recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 *
 * 5. Termination
 * --------------
 *
 * 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 * if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 * compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 * Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 * Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 * ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 * non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 * come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 * Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 * notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 * first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 * from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 * Your receipt of the notice.
 *
 * 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 * infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 * counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 * directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 * You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 * 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 *
 * 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 * end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 * have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 * prior to termination shall survive termination.

 * *  6. Disclaimer of Warranty                                           *
 * *  -------------------------                                           *
 * *                                                                      *
 * *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
 * *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
 * *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 * *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 * *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 * *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 * *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 * *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 * *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 * *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
 * *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
 * *                                                                      *

 * ************************************************************************
 * *                                                                      *
 * *  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *
 * *  --------------------------                                          *
 * *                                                                      *
 * *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
 * *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
 * *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
 * *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
 * *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
 * *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
 * *  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
 * *  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
 * *  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
 * *  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
 * *  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
 * *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
 * *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
 * *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
 * *  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
 * *                                                                      *
 * ************************************************************************
 *
 * 8. Litigation
 * -------------
 *
 * Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
 * courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
 * place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
 * jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
 * Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
 * cross-claims or counter-claims.
 *
 * 9. Miscellaneous
 * ----------------
 *
 * This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 * matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 * unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 * necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
 * that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
 * shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
 *
 * 10. Versions of the License
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * 10.1. New Versions
 *
 * Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
 * 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 * publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 * distinguishing version number.
 *
 * 10.2. Effect of New Versions
 *
 * You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
 * of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
 * or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
 * steward.
 *
 * 10.3. Modified Versions
 *
 * If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
 * create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
 * modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
 * any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
 * such modified license differs from this License).
 *
 * 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
 * Licenses
